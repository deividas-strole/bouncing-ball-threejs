# Bouncing Ball — Three.js Physics Simulation by Deividas Strole

Bouncing Ball is a satisfying, real-time 3D physics demo built with **Three.js**. Created by Deividas Strole, this project features a colorful ball bouncing inside a transparent box with realistic gravity, elastic collisions, and smooth lighting effects.

Perfect as a fun showcase of Three.js capabilities, basic physics simulation, and interactive 3D web graphics.

Developed by Deividas Strole as part of his growing collection of creative Three.js experiments.

Here are some visual previews of similar bouncing ball physics simulations in Three.js:

🚀 Overview

A shiny ball continuously bounces around the inside of a glass-like cube, reacting to gravity and walls with realistic reflections and shadows. The scene includes dynamic lighting, camera orbit controls, and a clean, modern aesthetic — all running smoothly in the browser.

Built by Deividas Strole to explore Three.js scene setup, object animation, and simple collision detection.

✨ Key Features

- Realistic gravity-based bouncing physics
- Elastic collisions with all six walls of the container
- Beautiful lighting with ambient + directional lights
- Interactive orbit controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- Responsive full-screen WebGL canvas
- Lightweight — runs on Three.js + basic JavaScript
- Clean, minimal code structure
